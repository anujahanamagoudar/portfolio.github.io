                    <h3>What is the course about?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Design and Analysis of Algorithms course is all about developing a deep understanding of how algorithms work, how they are designed, and how they can be optimized for efficiency.
                        This course emphasizes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The systematic design of algorithms.</li>
                            <li>The analysis of their time and space complexities.</li>
                            <li>The application of mathematical tools to compare algorithm performance.</li>
                        </ul>
                        By studying this, I have gained the skills to approach problems systematically, design solutions, and measure their efficiency.

                    <h3>What kind of data structures and algorithms have I studied?</h3>
                    <p>
                        During the course, I explored a variety of data structures and algorithms, including:
                        <strong>Data Structures:</strong> Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables.
                        <br><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort, graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s and Kruskal’s, and advanced string matching algorithms like Rabin-Karp and Boyer-Moore.

                    <h3>CONNECTION WITH REAL WORLD</h3>
                    <p>
                        The course has practical applications in a variety of fields such as software development, artificial intelligence, and data science. Understanding how to optimize algorithms is crucial when working with large datasets, building scalable systems, or creating intelligent systems.
