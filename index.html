            <h2>Course Introduction</h2>
            <p><strong>Course Name:</strong> Design Analysis and Algorithms (DAA)</p>
            <p><strong>Course Code:</strong> 24ECSC205</p>
            <p><strong>Instructor:</strong> Arundhati Mam</p>
            <p><strong>University:</strong> KLE Technological University</p>
            <p>This course focuses on the design and analysis of algorithms to solve real-world problems efficiently. We explore different data structures and algorithmic techniques such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, recursion, backtracking, and graph algorithms. These concepts are fundamental in optimizing real-time applications in various fields, including computer systems, web development, and data analytics.</p>
            <p>The course has equipped us with the tools to approach complex problems systematically, considering factors like time and space complexity, as well as understanding when and how to apply specific techniques for maximum efficiency.</p>

            <h2>Course Project</h2>
            <p><strong>Problem Space:</strong> The project involves applying data structures and algorithms to optimize city designs. We focused on designing algorithms to address key challenges in urban planning, transportation, and business operations.</p>
            <p><strong>Team Members:</strong> The team consists of diverse members, each focusing on a specific business case such as traffic optimization, waste management, and resource allocation using advanced algorithms like graph traversal, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.</p>
            <p><strong>Business Cases:</strong> The business cases include optimizing city traffic flow using graph-based algorithms, improving waste collection using dynamic programming, and designing smart resource management systems through greedy algorithms.</p>

            <h2>Course Learning Reflections</h2>
            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p><strong>Efficiency in Algorithms:</strong> Throughout the course, we have learned the importance of both space and time efficiency. The various classes of problems such as NP-hard, NP-complete, and polynomial time problems require different strategies for optimization.</p>
            <p><strong>Design Principles:</strong> The principles of design, such as breaking down problems into smaller subproblems and optimizing for the best case scenario, have helped us create efficient solutions for real-world applications.</p>
            <p><strong>Application of Data Structures:</strong> The course gave us insights into different tree data structures, including AVL trees and red-black trees, and their applications in balancing and optimizing searches in databases.</p>
