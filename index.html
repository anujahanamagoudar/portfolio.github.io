                    <h3>What is the course about?</h3>
                    <p>
The Design and Analysis of Algorithms course is all about developing a deep understanding of how algorithms work, how they are designed, and how they can be optimized for efficiency.

This course emphasizes:

The systematic design of algorithms.
The analysis of their time and space complexities.
The application of mathematical tools to compare algorithm performance.
By studying this, I have gained the skills to approach problems systematically, design solutions, and measure their efficiency.

                    <h3>What kind of data structures and algorithms have I studied?</h3>
                    <p>
During the course, I explored a variety of data structures and algorithms, including:

Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables.
Algorithms: Sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort, graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s and Kruskal’s, and advanced string matching algorithms like Rabin-Karp and Boyer-Moore.
Each topic built upon the foundational knowledge, helping me to analyze problems from different perspectives and apply the most suitable data structure or algorithm.
